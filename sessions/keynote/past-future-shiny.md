<!-- ABSTRACT ----
Please write abstract below. You may use simple markdown (links, code style, bold, italics)

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) is a package that makes it easy to create
interactive web apps using R. It's hard to believe, but it's been ten whole
years since the launch of Shiny! I'll mark the occasion by sharing some stories
about the creation of Shiny, the conditions that have made it a success over the
years, and our plans for the near future.
